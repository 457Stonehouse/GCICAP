<p>This script is designed to create an automatic air defence system for the red and blue coalitions. It includes automatic spawning of Combat Air Patrol aircraft (CAP) and Ground Controlled Intercept aircraft (GCI) in response to enemy air movements that are detected by a ground based radar network. 
CAP flights will take off and proceed to designated CAP zones where they will remain on station until the ground radars direct them to intercept detected enemy aircraft or they run short of fuel and must return to base (RTB). When a CAP flight leaves their zone to perform an interception or return to base a new CAP flight will spawn to take their place.
If all CAP flights are engaged or RTB then additional GCI interceptors will scramble to intercept unengaged enemy aircraft under ground radar control.
With a little time and with a little work it provides the mission designer with a convincing and completely automatic air defence system that eliminates the need for hand scripting and building the required aircraft and flight paths. In short it is a plug in very flexible and configurable air defence module for DCS World.</p>
